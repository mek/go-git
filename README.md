# go-git
My own wrapper for git, written in go. 

## Reasoning

I like to but a wrapper around git so I can alias commands, set rules for various branches, etc. Orginally I wrote this in [TCL](https://tcl-lang.org) but I needed a non-TCL based version. So, I wrote it in go. 

## Interation One

I simply did a very basic TCL -> Go conversion. The code isn't self isn't very go-ey. 

The biggest problem was getting the arguments write for running the git command. I'm not happy with it yet, but it is a decent starting point and I can eatting my own dog food right now.
